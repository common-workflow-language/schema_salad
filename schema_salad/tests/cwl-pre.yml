    "doc": "Represents a file (or group of files when `secondaryFiles` is provided) that\nwill be accessible by tools using standard POSIX file system call API such as\nopen(2) and read(2).\n\nFiles are represented as objects with `class` of `File`.  File objects have\na number of properties that provide metadata about the file.\n\nThe `location` property of a File is a URI that uniquely identifies the\nfile.  Implementations must support the file:// URI scheme and may support\nother schemes such as http://.  The value of `location` may also be a\nrelative reference, in which case it must be resolved relative to the URI\nof the document it appears in.  Alternately to `location`, implementations\nmust also accept the `path` property on File, which must be a filesystem\npath available on the same host as the CWL runner (for inputs) or the\nruntime environment of a command line tool execution (for command line tool\noutputs).\n\nIf no `location` or `path` is specified, a file object must specify\n`contents` with the UTF-8 text content of the file.  This is a \"file\nliteral\".  File literals do not correspond to external resources, but are\ncreated on disk with `contents` with when needed for a executing a tool.\nWhere appropriate, expressions can return file literals to define new files\non a runtime.  The maximum size of `contents` is 64 kilobytes.\n\nThe `basename` property defines the filename on disk where the file is\nstaged.  This may differ from the resource name.  If not provided,\n`basename` must be computed from the last path part of `location` and made\navailable to expressions.\n\nThe `secondaryFiles` property is a list of File or Directory objects that\nmust be staged in the same directory as the primary file.  It is an error\nfor file names to be duplicated in `secondaryFiles`.\n\nThe `size` property is the size in bytes of the File.  It must be computed\nfrom the resource and made available to expressions.  The `checksum` field\ncontains a cryptographic hash of the file content for use it verifying file\ncontents.  Implementations may, at user option, enable or disable\ncomputation of the `checksum` field for performance or other reasons.\nHowever, the ability to compute output checksums is required to pass the\nCWL conformance test suite.\n\nWhen executing a CommandLineTool, the files and secondary files may be\nstaged to an arbitrary directory, but must use the value of `basename` for\nthe filename.  The `path` property must be file path in the context of the\ntool execution runtime (local to the compute node, or within the executing\ncontainer).

Alternately, if the file `cwl.output.json` is\npresent in the output, `outputBinding` is ignored.\n\nFile objects in the output must provide either a `location` URI or a `path`\nproperty in the context of the tool execution runtime (local to the compute\nnode, or within the executing container).\n\nWhen evaluating an ExpressionTool, file objects must be referenced via\n`location` (the expression tool does not have access to files on disk so\n`path` is meaningless) or as file literals.  It is legal to return a file\nobject with an existing `location` but a different `basename`.  The\n`loadContents` field of ExpressionTool inputs behaves the same as on\nCommandLineTool inputs, however it is not meaningful on the outputs.\n\nAn ExpressionTool may forward file references from input to output by using\nthe same value for `location`.\n",

It is legal to reference an\nunchanged File or Directory object taken from input as a secondaryFile.\n\nTo work on non-filename-preserving storage systems, portable tool\ndescriptions should avoid constructing new values from `location`, but\nshould construct relative references using `basename` or `nameroot`\ninstead.\n\nIf a value in `secondaryFiles` is a string that is not an expression,\nit specifies that the following pattern should be applied to the path\nof the primary file to yield a filename relative to the primary File:\n\n  1. If string begins with one or more caret `^` characters, for each\n    caret, remove the last file extension from the path (the last\n    period `.` and all following characters).  If there are no file\n    extensions, the path is unchanged.\n  2. Append the remainder of the string to the end of the file path.\n"

      "# Abstract\n\nA Command Line Tool is a non-interactive executable program that reads\nsome input, performs a computation, and terminates after producing some\noutput.  Command line programs are a flexible unit of code sharing and\nreuse, unfortunately the syntax and input/output semantics among command\nline programs is extremely heterogeneous. A common layer for describing\nthe syntax and semantics of programs can reduce this incidental\ncomplexity by providing a consistent way to connect programs together.\nThis specification defines the Common Workflow Language (CWL) Command\nLine Tool Description, a vendor-neutral standard for describing the\nsyntax and input/output semantics of command line programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction to CWL Command Line Tool standard v1.0.2\n\nThis specification represents the third stable release from the CWL\ngroup.  Since the initial v1.0 release, v1.0.2 introduces the following\nupdates to the CWL Command Line Tool standard.  Documents should continue\nto use `cwlVersion: v1.0` and existing v1.0 documents remain valid,\nhowever CWL documents that relied on previously undefined or\nunderspecified behavior may have slightly different behavior in v1.0.2.\n\n  * 13 July 2016: Mark `baseCommand` as optional and update descriptive text.\n  * 14 November 2016: Clarify [SoftwareRequirement](#SoftwareRequirement)\n    `spec` fields.\n  * 12 March 2017:\n    * Mark `default` as not required for link checking.\n    * Add note that files in InitialWorkDir must have path in output directory.\n    * Add note that writable: true applies recursively.\n  * 23 July 2017: (v1.0.1)\n    * Add clarification about scattering over empty arrays.\n    * Clarify interpretation of `secondaryFiles` on inputs.\n    * Expanded discussion of semantics of `File` and `Directory` types\n    * Fixed typo \"EMACScript\" to \"ECMAScript\"\n    * Clarified application of input parameter default values when the input is `null` or undefined.\n    * Clarified valid types and meaning of the format field on inputs versus outputs\n    * Clarify that command line arguments must not interpreted as shell except when shellQuote: false\n    * Clarify behavior of `entryname`\n  * 10 August 2017: (v1.0.2)\n    * Clarify behavior resolving expressions in `secondaryFile`\n\nSince draft-3, v1.0 introduces the following changes and additions\nto the CWL Command Line Tool standard:\n\n  * The [Directory](#Directory) type.\n  * Syntax simplifcations: denoted by the `map<>` syntax. Example: inputs\n    contains a list of items, each with an id. Now one can specify\n    a mapping of that identifier to the corresponding\n    `CommandInputParameter`.\n    ```\n    inputs:\n     - id: one\n       type: string\n       doc: First input parameter\n     - id: two\n       type: int\n       doc: Second input parameter\n    ```\n    can be\n    ```\n    inputs:\n     one:\n      type: string\n      doc: First input parameter\n     two:\n      type: int\n      doc: Second input parameter\n    ```\n  * [InitialWorkDirRequirement](#InitialWorkDirRequirement): list of\n    files and subdirectories to be present in the output directory prior\n    to execution.\n  * Shortcuts for specifying the standard [output](#stdout) and/or\n    [error](#stderr) streams as a (streamable) File output.\n  * [SoftwareRequirement](#SoftwareRequirement) for describing software\n    dependencies of a tool.\n  * The common `description` field has been renamed to `doc`.\n\n\n## Purpose\n\nStandalone programs are a flexible and interoperable form of code reuse.\nUnlike monolithic applications, applications and analysis workflows which\nare composed of multiple separate programs can be written in multiple\nlanguages and execute concurrently on multiple hosts.  However, POSIX\ndoes not dictate computer-readable grammar or semantics for program input\nand output, resulting in extremely heterogeneous command line grammar and\ninput/output semantics among program.  This is a particular problem in\ndistributed computing (multi-node compute clusters) and virtualized\nenvironments (such as Docker containers) where it is often necessary to\nprovision resources such as input files before executing the program.\n\nOften this gap is filled by hard coding program invocation and\nimplicitly assuming requirements will be met, or abstracting program\ninvocation with wrapper scripts or descriptor documents.  Unfortunately,\nwhere these approaches are application or platform specific it creates a\nsignificant barrier to reproducibility and portability, as methods\ndeveloped for one platform must be manually ported to be used on new\nplatforms.  Similarly it creates redundant work, as wrappers for popular\ntools must be rewritten for each application or platform in use.\n\nThe Common Workflow Language Command Line Tool Description is designed to\nprovide a common standard description of grammar and semantics for\ninvoking programs used in data-intensive fields such as Bioinformatics,\nChemistry, Physics, Astronomy, and Statistics.  This specification\ndefines a precise data and execution model for Command Line Tools that\ncan be implemented on a variety of computing platforms, ranging from a\nsingle workstation to cluster, grid, cloud, and high performance\ncomputing platforms.\n",

Implementations may provide resolvers which map\nthese software identifer IRIs to some configuration action; or they can\nuse only the name from the `package` field on a best effort basis.\n\nFor example, the IRI https://packages.debian.org/bowtie could\nbe resolved with `apt-get install bowtie`. The IRI\nhttps://anaconda.org/bioconda/bowtie could be resolved with `conda\ninstall -c bioconda bowtie`.\n\nIRIs can also be system independent and used to map to a specific\nsoftware installation or selection mechanism.\nUsing [RRID](https://www.identifiers.org/rrid/) as an example:\nhttps://identifiers.org/rrid/RRID:SCR_005476\ncould be fulfilled using the above mentioned Debian or bioconda\npackage, a local installation managed by [Environement Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/),\nor any other mechanism the platform chooses. IRIs can also be from\nidentifer sources that are discipline specific yet still system\nindependent. As an example, the equivalent [ELIXIR Tools and Data\nService Registry](https://bio.tools) IRI to the previous RRID example is\nhttps://bio.tools/tool/bowtie2/version/2.2.8.\nIf supported by a given registry, implementations are encouraged to\nquery these system independent sofware identifier IRIs directly for\nlinks to packaging systems.\n\nA site specific IRI can be listed as well. For example, an academic\ncomputing cluster using Environement Modules could list the IRI\n`https://hpc.example.edu/modules/bowtie-tbb/1.22` to indicate that\n`module load bowtie-tbb/1.1.2` should be executed to make available\n`bowtie` version 1.1.2 compiled with the TBB library prior to running\nthe accompanying Workflow or CommandLineTool. Note that the example IRI\nis specific to a particular institution and computing environment as\nthe Environment Modules system does not have a common namespace or\nstandardized naming convention.\n\nThis last example is the least portable and should only be used if\nmechanisms based off of the `package` field or more generic IRIs are\nunavailable or unsuitable. While harmless to other sites, site specific\nsoftware IRIs should be left out of shared CWL descriptions to avoid\nclutter.\n",

      "# Abstract\n\nOne way to define a workflow is: an analysis task represented by a\ndirected graph describing a sequence of operations that transform an\ninput data set to output. This specification defines the Common Workflow\nLanguage (CWL) Workflow description, a vendor-neutral standard for\nrepresenting workflows intended to be portable across a variety of\ncomputing platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n## Introduction to CWL Workflow standard v1.0.2\n\nThis specification represents the third stable release from the CWL\ngroup.  Since the initial v1.0 release, v1.0.2 introduces the following\nupdates to the CWL Command Line Tool standard.  Documents should continue\nto use `cwlVersion: v1.0` and existing v1.0 documents remain valid,\nhowever CWL documents that relied on previously undefined or\nunderspecified behavior may have slightly different behavior in v1.0.2.\n\n  * 12 March 2017:\n    * Mark `default` as not required for link checking.\n    * Add note that recursive subworkflows is not allowed.\n    * Fix mistake in discussion of extracting field names from workflow step ids.\n  * 23 July 2017: (v1.0.1)\n    * Add clarification about scattering over empty arrays.\n    * Clarify interpretation of `secondaryFiles` on inputs.\n    * Expanded discussion of semantics of `File` and `Directory` types\n    * Fixed typo \"EMACScript\" to \"ECMAScript\"\n    * Clarified application of input parameter default values when the input is `null` or undefined.\n  * 10 August 2017: (v1.0.2)\n    * Clarify behavior resolving expressions in `secondaryFile`\n\nSince draft-3, v1.0 introduces the following changes and additions\nto the CWL Workflow standard:\n\n  * The `inputs` and `outputs` fields have been renamed `in` and `out`.\n  * Syntax simplifcations: denoted by the `map<>` syntax. Example: `in`\n    contains a list of items, each with an id. Now one can specify\n    a mapping of that identifier to the corresponding\n    `InputParameter`.\n    ```\n    in:\n     - id: one\n       type: string\n       doc: First input parameter\n     - id: two\n       type: int\n       doc: Second input parameter\n    ```\n    can be\n    ```\n    in:\n     one:\n      type: string\n      doc: First input parameter\n     two:\n      type: int\n      doc: Second input parameter\n    ```\n  * The common field `description` has been renamed to `doc`.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Common Workflow Language Command Line Tool Description express\nworkflows for data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Chemistry,\nPhysics, and Astronomy.  This specification is intended to define a data\nand execution model for Workflows that can be implemented on top of a\nvariety of computing platforms, ranging from an individual workstation to\ncluster, grid, cloud, and high performance computing systems.\n",

An implementation may\nchoose to either continue running other steps of a workflow, or terminate\nimmediately upon `permanentFailure`.\n\n* If any step of a workflow execution results in `permanentFailure`, then\nthe workflow status is `permanentFailure`.\n\n* If one or more steps result in `temporaryFailure` and all other steps\ncomplete `success` or are not executed, then the workflow status is\n`temporaryFailure`.\n\n* If all workflow steps are executed and complete with `success`, then the\nworkflow status is `success`.\n\n# Extensions\n\n[ScatterFeatureRequirement](#ScatterFeatureRequirement) and\n[SubworkflowFeatureRequirement](#SubworkflowFeatureRequirement) are\navailable as standard [extensions](#Extensions_and_Metadata) to core\nworkflow semantics.\n",
